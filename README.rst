PALAU LIMS
==========

This extension is an installable module that customizes `SENAITE LIMS`_ by
implementing Antibiotic Susceptibility Testing (AST) for Antimicrobial
Resistance (AMR) detection and surveillance, aimed for hospitals and human
health centres at the `Republic of Palau`_.

This extension is an installable module developed by `Naralabs`_ that
customizes `SENAITE LIMS`_ to the shared requirements of laboratories
implemented under the leadership of `Beyond Essential Systems`_ (BES).

This extension was developed as part of the `Project Olangch`_, a
transformative health information system project to strengthen the eHealth
ecosystem of the `Palau Ministry of Health and Human Services`_. Besides the
implementation of SENAITE LIMS, the project workplan includes the
implementation of `Tamanu`_, `mSupply`_, `Tupaia`_ and `DHIS2`_.

Besides functionalities and customizations tailored to the needs of target
laboratories, this extension depends on `bes.lims`_, another extension profile
that customizes SENAITE LIMS to the shared requirements of laboratories
implemented under the leadership of BES. As a result, the `palau.lims` add-on
also depends on the following products, that belong to the SENAITE LIMS
ecosystem:

- `senaite.patient`_: patients handling
- `senaite.abx`_: antibiotics handling
- `senaite.microorganism`_: microorganisms handling
- `senaite.ast`_: antibiotic sensitivity testing (AST)
